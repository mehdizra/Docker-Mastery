## In 2020, What's Up With Swarm's Latest Features?

With all the media excitement about the never-ending new Kubernetes projects, Swarm news can get drowned out.  I've written two articles on Swarm in 2018, and updated in 2019, and now there's more news in 2020, so I made a YouTube Live about everything going on.

Basically, Mirantis is pledging public support in 2020 and beyond by growing the Swarm/SwarmKit team and telling us about planned new features.

## Swarm Raft Quorum 
Also from DockerCon 2017, fellow Docker Captain and friend [Laura Frank](https://twitter.com/rhein_wein) had a great session on the internals of Swarm Managers and how quorum of their Raft log works, called ["Everything You Thought You Already Knew About Orchestration"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsv-q8WbIZY). She goes into the math of how you always need an odd number of Managers, and what happens when one or more fail.

She then shows various recovery options in case you "loose quorum" in your Swarm cluster. This video is demo heavy, so it's worth watching the whole thing!
