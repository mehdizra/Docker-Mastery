## Using Docker Hub Registry Images:
[docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=)
[docker official images](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/tree/master/library)
[Dockerfile commands](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/)

## S39 The Mighty Hub Using Docker Hub Registry 
### This Lecture: Review 
- Docker Hub, "the apt package system for Containers" 
- Official images and how to use them
	doesn't have the root address in their names.it means they usually work with the official team of that software who makes it.
	one of the best things about official images is the document of image
	their are some versions for official images
	every version can have some tags but only one digest SHA256 code
> [!idea]  Encrypting each image saves time and storage because it prevents repeated downloads on both Docker Hub and Docker clients.

 > [!cite] Alpine is a small distro of Linux 
 > some apps like Nginx have alpine version that is a small version ready to use in alpine 
- How to discern "good" public images ?
	To trusting  non-official images we pay attention to number of stars and number of pulls  
- Using different base images like Debian or Alpine 
- The recommended tagging scheme used by Official images 
## S40 images and their layers

### Image layers:
This is where the fundamental concept of the cache of image layers saves us a whole bunch of time and space. Because we don't need to download layers we already have, and remember it uses a unique SHA for each layer so it's guaranteed to be the exact layer it needs. It knows how to match them between Docker Hub and our local cache. As we make changes to our images, they create more layers.

If we decide that we want to have the same image be the base image for more layers, then it's only ever storing one copy of each layer.
In this system, really, one of the biggest benefits is that we're never storing the same image data more than once on our file system. It also means that when we're uploading and downloading we don't need to upload and download the same layers that we already have

### Copy On Write (COW)
How does Image layering work with containers?
If you have your image, let's say we have our Apache image, and we decide to run a container off of it, all Docker does is it creates a new read/write layer for that container on top of that Apache image. 
When we're perusing the file system and these things, all the containers and the images all just look like a regular file system, but underneath the storage driver that's used by Docker is actually layering, like a stack of pancakes, all these changes on top of each other.
So if I ran two containers at the same time off of the same Apache image, container 1 and container 2 would only be showing, in terms of the file space, they would only be the differencing between what's happened on that live container running and what is happening in the base image, which is read-only.
When you're running Containers and you're changing files that were coming through the image, let's say I started container 3, and I actually went in and changed a file that was in this image in the running container... This is known as copy-on-write.
What that does is the file system will take that file out of the image and copy it into this differencing up here... and store a copy of that file in the container layer.
So now the container is really only just the running process and those files that are different than they were in the Apache image.

 > [!cite] Images made up of two parts:
 > 1. binaries and its dependencies 
 > 2. the metadata about that image 

### inspect
show the metadata of image. the basic data that show us how the image should be run
```bash
docker image inspect
```

### Image and Their Layers: Review 
- Images are made up of file system changes and metadata 
- Each layer is uniquely identified and only stored once on a host 
- This saves storage space on host and transfer time on push/pull 
- A container is just a single read/write layer on top of image 
- docker image history and inspect commands can teach us 
مواردی که در این جلسه آموختیم:
- سیستم هوشمند لایه بندی ایمیج ها در داکر به این صورت است که هر لایه یک کد رمزنگاری شده یکتا دارد و بر این مبنا در صورتی که این کد رمزنگاری شده روی سرور (هاب یا هاست) وجود داشته باشند آن لایه مجددا دانلود یا آپلود نخواهد شد و این امر از انتقال داده های تکراری جلوگیری میکند.
- **هر کانتینری که اجرا می شود یک لایه بالایی روی لایه های ایمیج است و اگر در حین اجرا تصمیم به تغییر یکی از فایل های ایمیج داشته باشیم، آن فایل به لایه بالا (کانتینر در حال اجرا) کپی می شود و در همان لایه تغییرات اعمال می شود که به این فرایند COW گفته می شود.**
## S41 Image tagging and Pushing to Docker Hub
### This Lecture: Requirements 
- Know what container and images are 
- Understand image layer basics 
- Understand Docker Hub basics 
### This Lecture 
- All about image tags 
- How to upload to Docker Hub 
- Image ID vs. Tag 
### Official Repositories
They live at the root namespace of the registry, so they don't need account name in front of repo name.
### Tag
It's not quite a version and it's not quite a branch. It's just a pointer to a specific image commit and could be anything
> [!idea] every image can have a lot of tag but only one image ID 

#### Tag command
```bash
mmzare@:)Linux ~$ docker image tag --help
Usage:  docker image tag SOURCE_IMAGE[:TAG] TARGET_IMAGE[:TAG]
mmzare@:)Linux ~$ docker image tag alpine mehdi/alpine # without tag latest has chosen 
mmzare@:)Linux ~$ docker image tag alpine mehdi/alpine:final
mmzare@:)Linux ~$ docker image ls
REPOSITORY                 TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
mehdi/alpine               final     05455a08881e   5 weeks ago    7.38MB
mehdi/alpine               latest    05455a08881e   5 weeks ago    7.38MB
alpine                     3.19      05455a08881e   5 weeks ago    7.38MB
alpine                     latest    05455a08881e   5 weeks ago    7.38MB
```
### Docker pull 
if we pull two same image with different tag, they're not really stored twice in the cache. because they have same image ID system doesn't download it again. but with `image ls` command we see every tag that we use during the download. (latest is the default tag)
```bash
mmzare@:)Linux ~$ docker image pull alpine:3.19
mmzare@:)Linux ~$ docker image pull alpine
mmzare@:)Linux ~$ docker image ls
REPOSITORY                 TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
alpine                     3.19      05455a08881e   5 weeks ago    7.38MB
alpine                     latest    05455a08881e   5 weeks ago    7.38MB
```
#### Docker login
to pushing data over docker hub we should sign up and login at first
```bash
mmzare@:)Linux ~$ docker login
# Log in with your Docker ID or email address to push and pull images from Docker Hub. If you don't have a Docker ID, head over to https://hub.docker.com/ to create one. You can log in with your password or a Personal Access Token (PAT). Using a limited-scope PAT grants better security and is required for organizations using SSO. Learn more at https://docs.docker.com/go/access-tokens/
Username: mmzare@gmail.com
Password:
Login Succeeded
```
authentication key will stored in `~/.docker/config.json` and we should log out, when we are done
```bash
mmzare@:)Linux ~$ cat .docker/config.json
{
        "auths": {
                "https://index.docker.io/v1/": {}
        },
        "credsStore": "desktop.exe"
}
mmzare@:)Linux ~$ docker logout
Removing login credentials for https://index.docker.io/v1/
mmzare@:)Linux ~$ cat .docker/config.json
{
        "auths": {},
        "credsStore": "desktop.exe"
}
```
### Docker Push
```bash
mmzare@:)Linux ~$ docker push --help
Usage:  docker push [OPTIONS] NAME[:TAG]
Upload an image to a registry
```
### Private Docker Hub Images
to create private docker hub images we should create it from Dockerhub website
![[Pasted image 20240306122020.png]]
## This Lecture: Review 
- Properly tagging images 
- Tagging images for upload to Docker Hub 
- How tagging is related to image ID 
- The Latest Tag 
- Logging into Docker Hub from docker cli 
- How to create private Docker Hub images
### Prune
You can use "prune" commands to clean up images, volumes, build cache, and containers. Examples include:

- `docker image prune` to clean up just "dangling" images
- `docker system prune` will clean up everything
- The big one is usually `docker image prune -a` which will remove all images you're not using. Use `docker system df` to see space usage.

Remember each one of those commands has options you can learn with `--help`.

Here's a YouTube video I made about it: [https://youtu.be/_4QzP7uwtvI](https://youtu.be/_4QzP7uwtvI)

Lastly, realize that if you're using Docker Toolbox, the Linux VM won't auto-shrink. You'll need to delete it and re-create (make sure anything in docker containers or volumes are backed up). You can recreate the toolbox default VM with `docker-machine rm default` and then `docker-machine create`
