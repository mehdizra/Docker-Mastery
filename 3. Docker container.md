### Running nginx sample
```bash
mmzare@:)Linux ~$ docker container run --publish 80:80 nginx # change host listening port
mmzare@:)Linux ~$ docker container run -d --publish 80:80 nginx # -d or --detach
mmzare@:)Linux ~$ docker container ls # List of runing containers
mmzare@:)Linux ~$ docker container ls -a # List of all containers
mmzare@:)Linux ~$ docker container stop d0e45534rft # Stop container with ID
mmzare@:)Linux ~$ docker container stop funny_khorana # Stop container with name 
mmzare@:)Linux ~$ docker container run -p 80:80 --name webhost nginx # pick a name
mmzare@:)Linux ~$ docker container logs webhost # show logs
mmzare@:)Linux ~$ docker container rm compassionate_dijkstra silly_booth # remove containers based on names
mmzare@:)Linux ~$ docker container rm -f # remove with force
```
 > [!cite] --publish or -p 
 > Remember publishing ports is always in HOST:CONTAINER format

> [!idea] Names
> every container should have a unique name
> but if user does not choose a name docker will be choose a random name

> [!idea] Nginx processes 
>  there is a master process and then it spawns worker processes based on the configuration

```bash
docker container run -d -p 3306:3306 --name db -e MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=yes mysql
docker container logs db
docker container run -d -p 8080:80 --name web httpd
docker container run -d -p 80:80 --name proxy nginx

## what's going on in containers from outside

> [!important] 
> **top** show process list in one container
> **inspect** show metadata about one container config in a json file  (startup, config, volumes, networking, etc.). It doesn't tell us anything about the active container and what it's doing.
> **stats** show list of active container with CPU and ram performance monitoring
 
```bash
mmzare@:)Linux ~$ docker top welcome-to-docker
mmzare@:)Linux ~$ docker inspect welcome-to-docker
mmzare@:)Linux ~$ docker stats
```

## S26 what's going on in containers from inside
we have this ability to SSH inside of container but we don't needed
there is several command to give access inside of container
### docker container run -it
start new container with a command, and it will be running as long as the command still running
```bash
docker container run -it # start new container interactively
docker container exec -it # run additional command in runnig container
mmzare@:)Linux ~$ docker container run --help
```

Usage:  docker container run OPTIONS IMAGE COMMAND ARG...
  -a, --attach list                    Attach to STDIN, STDOUT or STDERR
  -i, --interactive                    Keep STDIN open even if not attached (keep session open to receive terminal input)
  -t, --tty                            Allocate a pseudo-TTY (give something like SSH to us)
> [!idea] Pseudo-terminals are emulators for serial lines. They provide endpoints for telnet, ssh, and xterm shells.
> 

> [!idea] every image has a default command after image that can be changed 
> but when we want to run container with -i we should select an a command to run after running image

#### samples:
```bash
mmzare@:)Linux ~$ docker container run -it -d --name server1 nginx bash
# bash if run with -it, it will give you a terminal inside the running container
```
when we exit the shell, the container stopped because containers only run as long as the command that it ran on startup runs.

 > [!cite] containers only run as long as the command that it ran on startup runs.

```bash
mmzare@:)Linux ~$ docker container run -it -d --name ubu ubuntu
# start a linux ubuntu as a container
```
> [!idea]  Linux containers are minimal distributions of OS and every app that we need on that should be install
> 

**for existing and stopped containers use start and -a instead of -t to have access to inside of container**
```bash
mmzare@:)Linux ~$ docker container start -ia ubu
```
### docker container exec 
run additional process in running container
```bash
mmzare@:)Linux ~$ docker container exec --help
Usage:  docker container exec [OPTIONS] CONTAINER COMMAND [ARG...]
Execute a command in a running container

Aliases:
  docker container exec, docker exec

Options:
  -d, --detach               Detached mode: run command in the background
      --detach-keys string   Override the key sequence for detaching a container
  -e, --env list             Set environment variables
      --env-file list        Read in a file of environment variables
  -i, --interactive          Keep STDIN open even if not attached
      --privileged           Give extended privileges to the command
  -t, --tty                  Allocate a pseudo-TTY
  -u, --user string          Username or UID (format: "<name|uid>[:<group|gid>]")
  -w, --workdir string       Working directory inside the container
```

## Alpine
A small security-focused distribution
it's very small Linux
it comes with its own package manager
there is no bash in Alpine and we can use sh instead of bash
```bash
mmzare@:)Linux ~$ docker container run -it alpine bash
docker: Error response from daemon: failed to create task for container: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: exec: "bash": executable file not found in $PATH: unknown.
ERRO[0000] error waiting for container:
mmzare@:)Linux ~$ docker container run -it alpine sh
```
> [!idea] There is no bash in alpine Linux by default
> we can only run things in the container that already exists in its image when we started it, and something that we've added later through the exec or run commands 

## network
run a container with a specific network:
```bash
docker container run --network my_net nginx
```
