three important thing in docker 
they called in docker : build ship run
## 1. docker image : 
==universal app package manager==
`docker build` command make a docker image
docker image is a container image known as OCI image
> [!NOTE] OCI image
> **The combination of the image manifest, image configuration, and one or more filesystem serializations** is called the OCI Image
> 
image layers: programing languages , libraries, apps and sometimes metadata

## 2. docker registry
==universal app distribution==
is for app distribution known as OCI registry specification or OCI distribution spec
> [!NOTE] shiping
> its standard in whole industry to how to move container images around
like docker hub, github, gitlab

`docker push` & `docker pull` commands move the registry to another machines (and another platforms)

## 3. docker [[3. Docker container]]
==identical runtime environment==
the docker engine in a single machine Orchestrate or Manage all the different things in order
`docker run` command run the app 
and we can have bunch of containers on every machine

> [!hint] Build Ship Run
>  The [Build Ship Run] idea is one of the core principles of containers, kubernetes, helm and other projects.


# why we use Docker
## 1. Isolation
instead of a lot of server or a lot of virtual machine docker gives us isolation for each container with their own IP address and file system and without a lot of OS like VMs model
## 2. Environments
containers are a consistent standard format now known as the OCI standards. Those ensure that wherever you run the container, it will be run the same consistent way with the same exact dependencies it was built with

## 3. speed
we are talking about speed of  business
with containers we isolated workloads inside them and we develop faster, built faster, test faster and deploy faster

# Docker Course Roadmap

  > [!cite] Linux containers require a Linux Kernel(OS) 
>  Docker or any container requires the container image to run, on a kernel, that was designed for it
>  *if you build an app on windows, it has to be run on windows*
>  *most containers (99%) run on a Linux kernel Which means, when you install Docker Desktop or some of the alternate ways to run containers, these tools typically will manage a local VM, running a tiny Linux kernel and a tiny container file system.*

> [!idea] Open Container Initiative
The **Open Container Initiative** is an open governance structure for the express purpose of creating open industry standards around container formats and runtimes. 

> [!code] [WSL2]
> Windows subsystem for Linux, its the best way to run Linux on Windows
